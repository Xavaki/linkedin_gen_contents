Fragmentación global y liderazgo empresarial débil amenazan los ODS,https://diarioresponsable.com/noticias/38218-fragmentacion-global-y-liderazgo-empresarial-debil-amenazan-los-ods,2025-06-18,"A joint report by Esade and Fundación ""la Caixa"" highlights the stagnation or regression of 83% of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) a decade after their adoption. Despite increased ESG reporting, concrete actions remain insufficient to address critical global sustainability challenges, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and inequality. The study attributes the lack of progress to fragmented international cooperation, weak multilateral institutions, geopolitical conflicts, and misaligned green agendas.

The report calls for stronger corporate leadership in sustainability, urging businesses to go beyond regulatory compliance and integrate justice-driven ecological transitions into their strategies. While ESG transparency among firms has improved significantly, impactful measures such as emission reductions across supply chains or biodiversity assessments lag behind. Additionally, governance practices show some progress, like the inclusion of sustainability experts and women in boardrooms, but gender parity remains elusive at executive and workforce levels.

Gartner predicts that by 2025, 75% of medium and large organizations will formalize data governance functions as part of their business strategy. This reinforces the need to institutionalize data as a core business component. The agility of a ""startup mindset"" within the data office further promotes collaboration, dismantles silos, and enables a continuous evaluation of data product lifecycles to maximize value.

However, the technology's apparent reliability can mask critical flaws—generating inaccurate information with a persuasive appearance that diminishes critical thinking. This risk is compounded by the era of widespread misinformation, where AI is often mistakenly perceived as an infallible source of truth.

Generative AI has inherent risks, including the propagation of subtle inaccuracies and the reinforcement of biases due to uncritical usage patterns. When erroneous data is repeatedly circulated, it can become entrenched as collective knowledge, posing serious challenges in sensitive fields like health, law, and politics.

Jordan, a renowned scientist from UC Berkeley, highlights his work on ""collective AI,"" which integrates economics, statistics, and information sciences to foster human connections and create value in real-world scenarios. He emphasizes AI’s transformative potential in industries like music, fraud detection, and personalized medicine, while cautioning about its risks, such as spreading misinformation.

Jordan underscores the importance of human adaptability and responsible use of AI in supporting democracy and economic growth. He predicts changes in employment trends, as AI automates certain tasks, yet opens opportunities for emerging professions. To maximize AI's benefits, he advocates for balanced integration and societal adjustments to technological reliance.

"Formación dual, el antídoto de la escasez de talento",https://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2025/06/20/6855b337e4d4d8a44b8b45ca.html,2025-06-20,"Spain faces significant challenges in bridging the gap between labor market demands, education systems, and rapid technological advancements reshaping job profiles. The country's dual vocational training model, now mainstream due to the new 2022 legislation, offers a compelling solution. By integrating classroom education with practical experience in companies, this system empowers businesses to proactively develop the skills they require, reducing hiring costs and expediting workforce integration.

The current mismatch is stark: while over 50% of future jobs in regions like Catalonia will require middle-level qualifications, only 24% of the workforce meets that criterion. This gap, exacerbated by automation and AI's labor market transformations, highlights the urgency for robust collaboration between education centers and businesses. To succeed, centers need autonomy and adaptability to align with local economic needs, while companies must invest structurally—not sporadically—in training partnerships.

As seen in countries like Germany and Switzerland, dual vocational models directly contribute to competitiveness, productivity, and regional development. For Spain, this approach represents an essential strategy for addressing talent shortages, navigating generational transitions, and advancing workforce professionalization. Business leaders are encouraged to shift focus from searching for talent to fostering it systematically.",el_mundo,es,NR,NR,R,NR,R,NR,NR,NR

Decker emphasizes Verdi's personal connection to the work, shaped by the composer’s own tragic losses, while the opera explores universal sentiments like jealousy, sacrifice, and the corrupting influence of wealth. Nadine Sierra notes parallels between the protagonist's struggles and real-life tensions surrounding gender and fleeting youth.

"Ciencia sin industria, talento sin destino",https://www.jornada.com.mx/2025/06/18/opinion/016a1pol,2025-06-18,"The article critiques Mexico's scientific policy since the 1980s, arguing that the adoption of a neoliberal economic model disconnected science from industrial and national development. With foreign-controlled industries maintaining their research centers abroad, local scientific advancement became irrelevant to economic needs. This shift led to the academic isolation of science and technology, focusing more on individual achievements like publications rather than addressing public challenges or fostering innovation.

The creation of the National System of Researchers (SNI) has encouraged a symbolic, individualistic approach to science, prioritizing external recognition while neglecting collective evaluation or real-world application. This has resulted in a growing number of researchers without meaningful integration into the saturated academic system or the production sector. Mexico’s sciences remain fragmented, with limited contributions to national planning, reindustrialization, or development strategies.

For professionals and leaders, the insight is clear: aligning scientific research with industrial and societal needs is crucial for meaningful progress. Without a strategy to integrate science, education, and production, Mexico risks perpetuating a cycle of disconnected intellectual output with limited impact on innovation, economic growth, or national development.",la_jornada,es,R,NR,R,NR,R,R,NR,NR

Organizations must move beyond generic or outdated descriptions to align profiles with strategic business needs, focusing on adaptability, specialization, and cultural fit. Common mistakes, such as using standardized or mismatched criteria, can lead to inefficiencies, premature turnover, and misaligned expectations.

Building accurate profiles requires rigorous methods, including organizational analysis, identifying key competencies, and mapping leadership styles. External consultants, like AdelantTa, offer specialized services to ensure alignment and efficiency in recruitment, helping businesses translate role-specific requirements into actionable hiring strategies. This approach reduces hiring times, improves candidate quality, and aligns talent acquisition with business goals.

For companies lacking internal HR expertise or resources, outsourcing services, such as HRO 360, provide strategic support across the talent lifecycle—from planning workforce needs to performance evaluation.

Automation solutions significantly improve data collection, validation, and reporting, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing accuracy.

The training process includes selecting suitable breeds, such as Labrador retrievers and shepherds, exposing them to the specific scent of the invasive species, and rewarding correct identifications through positive reinforcement. Advanced training involves systematic searches in natural habitats and socialization exercises to ensure effectiveness in varied environments.

In collaboration with Swiss company Arten Spürhunde and Acció Ecologista-Agró, the Valencian government has implemented programs to train dogs for turtle detection in the Marjal de Almenara. Since 2003, efforts have targeted controlling invasive turtle populations, capturing over 2,400 individuals in 2024 alone, and removing nests to mitigate their ecological impact. These initiatives support the conservation of native turtle species against the competitive threats posed by the invasive Florida turtles.

Abandoned pets, introduced in the 1990s, have contributed significantly to the spread of invasive turtles, leading to disease transmission and disruption of local ecosystems. To combat this, the region has intensified public awareness campaigns and set up centers to help rehome or manage these reptiles.

Leveraging insights from neuroscience, this approach emphasizes engaging all five senses to create deep, emotionally resonant connections with consumers, transcending traditional visual marketing. Studies show that campaigns utilizing multisensory elements boost memory retention by up to 70%, and sensory experiences like scent and touch play key roles in reinforcing brand loyalty and perception.

For instance, the scent of a product or environment can increase consumer recall by 35% compared to just 5% for visual stimuli, while tactile quality enhances perceived value, encouraging customers to pay more. Brands like Apple and Rolls-Royce invest heavily in sensory-driven experiences to elevate customer interaction and differentiate themselves.

Emerging technologies such as AI and extended reality are pushing the boundaries of sensory branding, enabling immersive experiences like virtual product trials with tactile feedback and curated soundscapes. This trend matters to professionals and businesses as it offers a powerful tool for enhancing customer engagement, building emotional loyalty, and achieving long-term differentiation in an increasingly saturated market.

In Spain, mental health disorders now account for 50% of medical leave, reflecting a growing trend globally, as highlighted by data from the WHO and the UK’s Mental Health First Aid Centre. Toxic workplace cultures—marked by poor communication, constant pressure, and authoritarian leadership—exacerbate these issues, while psychologically safe and empathetic cultures reduce absenteeism, improve engagement, and drive productivity.

In Spain, mental health-related absenteeism has risen by 121.55% in the last decade, costing nearly €29 billion in direct expenses and €21 billion in indirect losses, according to industry reports. Cultures that prioritize emotional well-being create resilient teams, reduce financial burdens, and strengthen business outcomes. Leadership plays a pivotal role in fostering these environments by normalizing mental health discussions, implementing real policies, and providing emotional support.

La paradoja del liderazgo moderno,https://www.rrhhdigital.com/secciones/liderazgo/774991/la-paradoja-del-liderazgo-moderno/,2025-06-17,"Leadership in the 21st century demands balancing seemingly opposing priorities: inspiring teams with vision and purpose while delivering results in high-pressure environments. This paradox requires leaders to integrate transformational leadership, which motivates through vision, with transactional leadership focused on operational metrics. Techniques like translating vision into clear goals, adopting ambidextrous leadership styles, and continuous feedback demonstrate that inspiration and efficiency are complementary when properly aligned.

Effective leaders must also manage empathy alongside performance demands. Strategies include fostering psychological safety within teams, using active empathy tied to accountability, and incorporating metrics for both employee well-being and business results. Companies like Salesforce demonstrate that balancing empathy with performance boosts morale and profitability.

Finally, leaders must navigate rapid change in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments, often without adequate training. Organizations can address this by investing in adaptive leadership skills, promoting mentorship and peer learning, and empowering a growth mindset that embraces learning through iterative processes. These approaches cultivate adaptability, bridging the gap between organizational demands and leadership readiness.
