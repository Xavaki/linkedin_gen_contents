Key challenges include fragmented markets, slower late-stage funding, and conservative corporate norms.\\n\\nDespite these hurdles, the report identifies emerging opportunities—such as AI, geopolitical shifts, and maturing capital infrastructure—that could enable Europe to create global software leaders. To capitalize on these prospects, the report outlines five interventions, including expanding late-stage funding, incentivizing cross-border growth for startups, and strengthening public-private partnerships. Additionally, the EU’s new Startup and Scaleup Strategy introduces reforms like a unified “28th regime” to simplify operations across member states.\\n\\nFor business leaders, this represents a critical moment to accelerate innovation and growth, leveraging enhanced funding models, borderless collaboration, and government support to compete globally in the software space.
