HopeJR is a full-size humanoid robot that has 66 actuated degrees of freedom, or 66 independent movements, including the ability to walk and move its arms. Reachy Mini is a desktop unit that can move its head, talk, listen, and be used to test AI apps.\\n\\nMeet HopeJr, a full humanoid robot lowering the barrier to entry!\\n\\n\\n\\nCapable of walking, manipulating many objects, open-source and costs under $3000 ü§Ø\\n\\n\\n\\nDesigned by @therobotstudio and @huggingface üëá pic.twitter.com/wCwo8YPOGV ‚Äî Remi Cadene (@RemiCadene) May 29, 2025\\n\\nHugging Face doesn‚Äôt have an exact timeline for shipping these robots. The company‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, told TechCrunch over email that they expect to start shipping at least the first few units by the end of the year, and the waitlist is currently open.\\n\\nReachy Mini Credit: Hugging Face\\n\\nHugging Face estimates that the HopeJR will cost around $3,000 per unit and the Reachy Mini will cost around $250 to $300, depending on tariffs.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [that they‚Äôre] affordable, so that robotics doesn‚Äôt get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,‚Äù Delangue said via email.\\n\\nThis robot release was made possible in part by the company‚Äôs acquisition of humanoid robotics startup Pollen Robotics, which was announced in April, according to Delangue. He added that the Pollen team gave Hugging Face ‚Äúnew capabilities‚Äù required to make these bots.\\n\\nHugging Face has been making a concerted push into the robotics industry over the past few years. It launched LeRobot, a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to build robotics systems, in 2024.\\n\\nTechcrunch event Save now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AI Save $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI‚Äîand get 50% off a second.
