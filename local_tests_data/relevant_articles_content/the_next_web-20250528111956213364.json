An onboard computer will stream this data to a machine learning algorithm that is trained to spot patterns and potential threats.\n\nThe technology is designed to help the Danish defence forces identify threats such as enemy submarines, illegal fishing, drug smuggling, or tampering with undersea cables. The drones will also perform deep-sea mapping to give authorities a clearer perspective of the ocean floor and underwater infrastructure, such as communication cables, pipelines, and offshore energy platforms.\n\nSurveillance of this kind has become increasingly urgent since the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, which exposed the vulnerability of underwater assets to covert attacks. Denmark is also stepping up its maritime defences in the Baltic Sea amid growing concerns over Russian aggression.\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThe robotic sailboats are made and operated by Saildrone, a US-based tech firm founded by British engineer Richard Jenkins in 2012. In its early days, Saildrone mainly focused on climate and weather surveying. But now the vast majority of its 140-strong fleet is deployed for defence and security purposes.\n\n\u201cThe Baltic, North Sea, and European Arctic waters are currently facing unprecedented threats,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cWe are very excited to be partnering with the Danish armed forces to deploy Saildrone systems to help protect Europe\u2019s critical undersea infrastructure and increase regional security.\u201d\n\nDenmark\u2019s army will begin testing the four vessels in June, as part of a broader effort to beef up its high-tech defences, including deploying mine-hunting underwater drones and uncrewed surveillance aircraft.\n\nLast month, the Nordic country announced a $614mn spending package. It will use the money to procure 26 new naval vessels, more drones, and sonar equipment in response to emerging maritime threats \u2014 particularly from Russia.\n\nLast month, the company set up a Danish subsidiary in Copenhagen, which it hopes will bring the technology closer to key defence markets including the UK, France, and Germany.\n\nDefence tech is a key theme of the Assembly, the invite-only policy track of TNW Conference. The event takes place in Amsterdam on June 19 \u2014 a week before the NATO Summit arrives in the city.\n\nTickets for TNW Conference are now on sale \u2014 use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the checkout to grab an exclusive discount.",
