The country is developing a promising ecosystem for neuromorphic computing, which draws on neuroscience to boost IT efficiencies and performance. Billions of euros are being invested in this new form of computing worldwide. The Netherlands aims to become a leader in the market by bringing together startups, established companies, government organisations, and academics in a neuromorphic computing ecosystem.\n\nA Dutch mission to the UK\n\nIn March, a Dutch delegation landed in the UK to host an \u201cInnovation Mission\u201d with local tech and government representatives. Top Sector ICT, a Dutch government\u2013supported organisation, led the mission, which sought to strengthen and discuss the future of neuromorphic computing in Europe and the Netherlands.\n\nWe contacted Top Sector ICT, who connected us with one of their collaborators: Dr Johan H. Mentink, an expert in computational physics at Radboud University in the Netherlands. Dr Mentink spoke about how neuromorphic computing can solve the energy, accuracy, and efficiency challenges of our current computing architectures.\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sign up now!\n\n\u201cCurrent digital computers use power-hungry processes to handle data,\u201d Dr Mentink said.\n\n\u201cThe result is that some modern data centres use so much energy that they even need their own power plant.\u201d\n\nComputing today stores data in one place (memory) and processes it in another place (processors). This means that a lot of energy is spent on transporting data, Dr Mentink explained.\n\nIn contrast, neuromorphic computing architectures are different at the hardware and software levels. For example, instead of using processors and memories, neuromorphic systems leverage new hardware components such as memristors. These act as both memory and processors.\n\nBy processing and saving data on the same hardware component, neuromorphic computing removes the energy-intensive and error-prone task of transporting data. Additionally, because data is stored on these components, it can be processed more immediately, resulting in faster decision-making, reduced hallucinations, improved accuracy, and better performance. This concept is being applied to edge computing, Industrial IoT, and robotics to drive faster real-time decision-making.\n\n\u201cJust like our brains process and store information in the same place, we can make computers that would combine data storage and processing in one place,\u201d Dr Mentink explained.\n\nEarly use cases for neuromorphic computing\n\nNeuromorphic computing is far from just experimental. A great number of new and established technology companies are heavily invested in developing new hardware, edge devices, software, and neuromorphic computing applications.\n\nBig tech brands such as IBM, NVIDIA, and Intel, with its Loihi chips, are all involved in neuromorphic computing, while companies in the Netherlands, aligned with a 2024 national white paper, are taking a leading regional role.\n\nFor example, the Dutch company Innatera \u2014 a leader in ultra-low power neuromorphic processors \u2014 recently secured \u20ac15 million in Series-A funding from Invest-NL Deep Tech Fund, the EIC Fund, MIG Capital, Matterwave Ventures, and Delft Enterprises.\n\nInnatera is just the tip of the iceberg, as the Netherlands continues to support the new industry through funds, grants, and other incentives.\n\nImmediate use cases for neuromorphic computing include event-based sensing technologies integrated into smart sensors such as cameras or audio. These neuromorphic devices only process change, which can dramatically reduce power and data load, said Sylvester Kaczmarek, the CEO of OrbiSky Systems, a company providing AI integration for space technology.\n\nNeuromorphic hardware and software have the potential to transfer AI running on the edge, especially for low-power devices such as mobile, wearables, or IoT.\n\nPattern recognition, keyword spotting, and simple diagnostics \u2014 such as real-time signal processing of complex sensor data streams for biomedical uses, robotics, or industrial monitoring \u2014 are some of the leading use cases, Dr Kaczmarek explained.\n\nWhen applied to pattern recognition and classification or anomaly detection, neuromorphic computing can make decisions very quickly and efficiently,\n\nProfessor Dr Hans Hilgenkamp, Scientific Director of the MESA+ Institute at the University of Twente, agreed that pattern recognition is one of the fields where neuromorphic computing excels.\n\n\u201cOne may also think about [for example] failure prediction in industrial or automotive applications,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gaps creating neuromorphic opportunities\n\nDespite the recent progress, the road to establishing robust neuromorphic computing ecosystems in the Netherlands is challenging. Globalised tech supply chains and the standardisation of new technologies leave little room for hardware-level innovation.\n\nFor example, optical networks and optical chips have proven to outperform traditional systems in use today, but the tech has not been deployed globally. Deploying new hardware involves strategic coordination between the public and private sectors. The global rollout of 5G technology provides a good example of the challenges. It required telcos and governments around the world to deploy not only new antennas, but also smartphones, laptops, and a lot of hardware that could support the new standard.\n\nOn the software side, meanwhile, 5G systems had a pressing need for global standards to ensure integration, interoperability, and smooth deployment. Additionally, established telcos had to move from pure competition to strategic collaboration\u2014 an unfamiliar shift for an industry long built on siloed operations.\n\nNeuromorphic computing ecosystems face similar obstacles. The Netherlands recognises that the entire industry\u2019s success depends on innovation in materials, devices, circuit designs, hardware architecture, algorithms, and applications.\n\nThese challenges and gaps are driving new opportunities for tech companies, startups, vendors, and partners.\n\nDr Kaczmarek told us that neuromorphic computing requires full-stack integration. This involves expertise that can connect novel materials and devices through circuit design and architectures to algorithms and applications. \u201cBringing these layers together is crucial but challenging,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the algorithms and software side of things, developing new paradigms of programming, learning rules (beyond standard deep learning backpropagation), and software tools native to neuromorphic hardware are also priorities.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to make the hardware usable and efficient \u2014 co-designing hardware and algorithms because they are intimately coupled in neuromorphic systems,\u201d said Dr Kaczmarek.\n\nOther industries which have developed or are considering research on neuromorphic computing include healthcare (brain-computer interfaces and prosthetics), agri-food, and sustainable energy.\n\nNeuromorphic computing modules or components can also be integrated with conventional CMOS, photonics, AI, and even quantum technologies.\n\nLong-term opportunities in the Netherlands\n\nWe asked Dr Hilgenkamp what expertise or innovations are most needed and offer the greatest opportunities for contribution and growth within this emerging ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe long-term developments involve new materials and a lot of research, which is already taking place on an academic level,\u201d Dr Hilgenkamp said.\n\nHe added that the idea of \u201cmaterials that can learn\u201d brings up completely new concepts in materials science that are exciting for researchers.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Mentink pointed to the opportunity to transform our economies, which rely on processing massive amounts of data.\n\n\u201cEven replacing a small part of that with neuromorphic computing will lead to massive energy savings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMoreover, with neuromorphic computing, much more processing can be done close to where the data is produced. This is good news for situations in which data contains privacy-sensitive information.\u201d\n\nConcrete examples, according to Dr Mentink, also include fraud detection for credit card transactions, image analysis by robots and drones, anomaly detection of heartbeats, and processing of telecom data.\n\n\u201cThe most promising use cases are those involving huge data flows, strong demands for very fast response times, and small energy budgets,\u201d said Dr Mentink.\n\nAs the use cases for neuromorphic computing increase, Dr Mentink expects the development of software toolchains that enable quick adoption of new neuromorphic platforms to see growth. This new sector would include services to streamline deployment.\n\n\u201cLonger-term sustainable growth requires a concerted interdisciplinary effort across the whole computing stack to enable seamless integration of foundational discoveries to applications in new neuromorphic computing systems,\u201d Dr Mentink said.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe potential of neuromorphic computing has translated into billions of dollars in investment in the Netherlands and Europe, as well as in Asia and the rest of the world.\n\nBusinesses that can innovate, develop, and integrate hardware and software-level neuromorphic technologies stand to gain the most.\n\nThe potential of neuromorphic computing for greater energy efficiency and performance could ripple across industries. Energy, healthcare, robotics, AI, industrial IoT, and quantum tech all stand to benefit if they integrate the technology. And if the Dutch ecosystem takes off, the Netherlands will be in a position to lead the way.\n\nSupporting Dutch tech is a key mission of TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
