    "content": "In Brief\n\nOpenAI pushed generative AI into the public consciousness. Now, it could be developing a very different kind of AI device.\n\nAccording to a WSJ report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees Wednesday that the company\u2019s next major product won\u2019t be a wearable. Instead, it will be a compact, screenless device, fully aware of its user\u2019s surroundings. Small enough to sit on a desk or fit in a pocket, Altman described it as both a \u201cthird core device\u201d alongside a MacBook Pro and iPhone, and an \u201cAI companion\u201d integrated into daily life.\n\nThe preview followed OpenAI\u2019s announcement that it will acquire io, a startup founded just last year by former Apple designer Jony Ive, in a $6.5 billion equity deal. Ive will take on a key creative and design role at OpenAI.\n\nAltman reportedly told employees the acquisition could eventually add $1 trillion in market value to the company as it creates a new category of devices unlike the handhelds, wearables, or glasses that other outfits have rolled out.\n\nAltman also reportedly emphasized to staff that secrecy will be critical to prevent competitors from copying the product before launch. As it turns out, a recording of his remarks leaked to the Journal, raising questions about how much he can trust his own team and how much more he\u2019ll be willing to disclose.",
