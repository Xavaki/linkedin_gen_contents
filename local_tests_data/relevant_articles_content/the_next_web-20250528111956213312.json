    "content": "Again, the German-Danish startup using ancient bacteria to turn CO2 into new chemicals, is building a new bioreactor plant in Texas.\n\nThe facility will be located at Texas City, a major petrochemicals park located on the Gulf Coast. The industrial centre is run by Diamond Infrastructure Solutions \u2014 a joint venture between chemicals giant Dow and Macquarie Asset Management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a global company, and that also means taking our technology into new regions,\u201d Again\u2019s co-founder Max Kufner told TNW. \u201cThere is a high demand in the US for our chemicals, particularly ones that can be sustainably made on-shore.\u201d\n\nThe new facility will capture CO2 from one of Texas City\u2019s refineries. Again will then combine the gas with hydrogen and feed the concoction to a host of millennia-old bacteria. The little germs devour the brew, turning it into commercial-grade compounds like acetate. This is the base chemical in everything from plastics and cosmetics to paint.\n\nMost industrial acetate is derived from fossil fuels. By using CO2 that would\u2019ve otherwise entered the atmosphere, Again aims to produce cleaner chemicals. The company claims its CO2 fermenter can cut the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of chemical-making by up to 80%.\n\nThe petrochemical industry is responsible for 4% of the world\u2019s total GHG emissions \u2014 twice that of air travel \u2014 so Again\u2019s tech could make a huge impact. The company also claims its product is cost-competitive with the same chemicals made using fossil fuels.\n\nAgain opened its first pilot plant in Copenhagen in 2023, which converts up to 1 tonne of CO2 each day and turns it into acetate. The company is also currently building a facility in Norway, backed by a $47mn grant from the EU\u2019s Horizon Europe research initiative.\n\nAgain emerged from over a decade of research led by Dr. Torbj\u00f8rn Jensen and Professor Alex Nielsen at the Technical University of Denmark. They teamed up with Kufner, a German former early-stage investor, to found the startup in 2021. So far, Again has raised $150mn, according to Dealroom.\n\nThe company has already broken ground at the Diamond Texas City site, where it aims to build a new facility and begin production within a year. To bring its low-carbon chemicals to market, Again is partnering with German chemicals distributor Helm, targeting heavy industries in the region as key customers.",
