    "content": "The rapid rise of AI agents is sparking both excitement and alarm.\n\nTheir power lies in their ability to complete tasks with increasing autonomy. Many can already pursue multi-step goals, make decisions, and interact with external systems \u2014 all with minimal human input. Teams of AI agents are beginning to collaborate, each handling a specialised role. As their autonomy increases, they\u2019re poised to reshape countless business processes.\n\nTech giants are heralding them as the future of the web. At Microsoft\u2019s Build conference this week, the company declared that we have entered \u201cthe era of AI agents.\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the event, proclaiming his lab\u2019s new Codex tool as \u201ca real agentic coding experience.\u201d He called it \u201cone of the biggest changes to programming that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nBeyond the hype, practical applications are rapidly emerging. AI agents are already assisting with various tasks, from code generation and cyber threat detection to customer service enquiries and shopping marketing campaigns.\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nBefore long, they could become comprehensive executive assistants \u2014 managing your emails, calendar, and projects. But to harness the opportunities, people need to prepare now.\n\nCihangir Kocak is helping them do just that. A principal business and AI strategist at HP, Kocak guides organisations through digital transformation. He believes AI agents will unleash a new wave of opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe are going to a future where everyone will have an AI agent as an assistant,\u201d he says.\n\nAt TNW Conference this summer, Kocak will host two sessions on AI agents. On June 19, he\u2019ll deliver a keynote on their rise. The next day, he\u2019ll join Joost Bos, Senior AI Engineer at Deloitte, for a masterclass titled \u201cAgentic AI: Architecting the Future of Business.\u201d\n\nAhead of the event, he shared a few of his tips.\n\n1. Understand what AI agents can do\n\nAI agents evolve large language models (LLMs) from passive responders into active problem-solvers. With tools, memory, and defined goals, they can complete complex tasks on their own.\n\n\u201cLarge language models act as the brains and AI agents as the hands, which means they can also act,\u201d Kocak says. \u201cThey can do things for you autonomously.\u201d\n\nAgents can also collaborate. One might source products, another handle logistics, a third build your website, and a fourth write the marketing copy. In future, businesses may need their own agents to interact with others. Your AI assistant could collaborate with them to book the best service for your needs.\n\nFree courses from the likes of Hugging Face, Salesforce, and Microsoft are good starting points to explore the possibilities.\n\nAfter getting an understanding of the basics, you can put them into practice.\n\n2. Start experimenting\n\nKocak expects AI agents to rapidly reshape workplaces. \u201cI believe that within five years, everything will be changed because of AI agents,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might be even much less than five years \u2014 maybe two to three years.\u201d\n\nMany companies are already shifting numerous tasks from humans to AI. In the near future, the people that they do recruit may require experience of working with AI agents.\n\n\u201cSoon, a lot of these companies will ask for people who can work with AI agents,\u201d says Kocak. His advice? \u201cGet your hands dirty. Play with it, experiment with it \u2014 but do it consciously.\u201d\n\nOne tool he recommends is LM Studio, a desktop app for running LLMs locally. But his key recommendation is simply getting started.\n\n\u201cJust do something to get a feel of it. Once you have that, it\u2019s time for the next step.\u201d\n\n3. Find use cases\n\nAfter testing some tools, Kocak suggests identifying where they can add value. He advises looking for tasks where AI can free up your time \u2014 and start small.\n\n\u201cWhat costs you the most time? What don\u2019t you like to do? When you figure out those things, you can look at how AI agents can help you.\u201d\n\nKocak uses local LLMs for privacy-sensitive tasks, and ChatGPT for public ones \u2014 like drafting LinkedIn posts in his own voice.\n\n\u201cIt saves at least half of my time,\u201d he says.\n\n4. Focus on the data\n\nThe real magic of AI agents emerges when they\u2019re personalised with your choice of data. Generic tools like ChatGPT can handle broad tasks. But if you want something tailored, agents trained on your choice of data can offer sharper performance.\n\nThat internal knowledge can turn a generic agent into a bespoke powerhouse. \u201cWhat makes an AI solution special is when you feed it with your own data,\u201d says Kocak. \u201cThen you will have a solution that can operate differently than anything else.\u201d\n\n5. Maintain human oversight\n\nAlthough AI agents can act autonomously, human oversight remains vital. Agents are powerful, but not flawless. Giving them too much freedom is risky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wise to have a human in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future will be AI agents plus humans \u2014 that will be the most beneficial combination.\u201d\n\n6. Stay secure\n\nAs AI tools become more accessible, security concerns are mounting. Among the threats are data leaks, adversarial attacks, and agents going off the rails. There\u2019s also the risk of losing a competitive edge.\n\n\u201cExternal parties can take your data and send it to their servers,\u201d says Kocak. \u201cThey can then use all sensitive data in your conversations to optimise their models.\u201d\n\nMany risks can be reduced by deploying open-source, local models \u2014 especially for sensitive data and use cases.\n\n\u201cIf you really want a competitive advantage, you need to run and own your AI. That sets you apart,\u201d says Kocak.\n\nHe adds that people shouldn\u2019t be fearful, but conscious. Closed-source, cloud-based tools such as ChatGPT remain useful \u2014 but sensitive data and tasks may require more secure alternatives.\n\n\u201cJust be aware of what information you enter. And remember there is another, better option, of running your large language model locally.\u201d\n\n7. Embrace the future\n\nAs the industrial revolution and factory automation did before them, AI agents will transform jobs. Some roles will disappear \u2014 but new ones will emerge.\n\nA welder could become an operator of robotic welders. A data entry clerk might oversee AI agents. Kocak is optimistic about the possibilities.\n\n\u201cOur core capabilities as humans \u2014 like being creative, finding solutions out of the box, and empathy \u2014 will come to the forefront.\u201d\n\nThese tips are just a glimpse of what Kocak will provide at TNW Conference.
