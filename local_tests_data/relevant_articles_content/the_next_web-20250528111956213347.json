    "content": "Europe has been turning uranium into energy for over half a century. In the process, the continent has amassed vast stockpiles of nuclear waste. This radioactive material can take millions of years to become safe, and no one really knows what to do with it.\n\nThorizon, a Franco-Dutch startup, has an idea: reuse the nuclear waste to generate new energy. The company is developing a small modular molten salt reactor (MSR) that runs on a mix of spent nuclear fuel and thorium, a radioactive metal with untapped potential.\n\nThorizon aims to begin construction of its first reactor, Thorizon One, within five years. Once complete, the plant is expected to produce 100 megawatts of electricity \u2014 enough to power around 100,000 homes or a major data centre.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just building a new type of reactor \u2014 we\u2019re rethinking how we use the fuel we already have,\u201d Thorizon\u2019s CEO Kiki Leuwers told TNW. \u201cEurope is sitting on a stockpile of valuable nuclear material. With the right technology, that waste becomes a resource.\u201d\n\nA 3D render of Thorizon\u2019s nuclear reactor: Credit: Thorizon\n\nWhen the radioactive uranium is used as fuel in a nuclear reactor, its atoms undergo fission, releasing heat. This heat is then used to produce steam, which spins a turbine to generate electricity. The radioactive waste produced in this process still retains around 90% of the uranium\u2019s original energy.\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

In the US, scientists believe it could power their country for around 100 years.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t we reusing nuclear waste?\n\nCountries including the US, France, and Japan have long understood the potential of reusing spent nuclear fuel. In the 1960s and \u201870s many so-called fast reactors were built \u2014 advanced designs capable of extracting more energy from nuclear fuel and even \u201cbreeding\u201d new fuel from waste. But in the decades that followed, most were phased out.\n\nThere were two key reasons: politics and economics. Fast reactors produce significant quantities of plutonium, the building block of atomic bombs. At the height of the Cold War, fears of nuclear proliferation prompted many countries, especially the US, to abandon efforts to recycle nuclear waste.\n\nAt the same time, global uranium supplies turned out to be far more abundant than expected. Discoveries of deposits in Australia, Canada, and Africa drove prices down, making it cheaper to mine fresh uranium than to invest in recycling infrastructure. Combined, these factors put radioactive recycling on ice.\n\nWhile France and Japan still reprocess some of their used fuel, most of the world\u2019s nuclear waste today ends up in massive steel cylinders called dry casks \u2014 a temporary solution to a very, very long-term problem. Efforts to bury it deep underground for eternity \u2014 like Finland\u2019s 500-metre-deep Onkalo repository \u2014 are making progress, but remain contentious and expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, expanding nuclear power in Europe continues to be a thorny issue, but the tide may be turning. Faced with the twin crises of climate change and energy insecurity, countries including the UK and France are pushing to expand nuclear power capacity, especially in small modular reactors (SMRs).\n\nWhether nuclear energy gets its moment back in the sun or not, Europe still has a massive nuclear waste problem. One that Thorizon hopes to clean up.\n\nHow will Thorizon\u2019s plant work?\n\nThorizon\u2019s MSR operates at high temperatures but low pressure, making it safer and more efficient. If something goes wrong, the salt solidifies and contains the radioactive material, limiting the risk of leaks or explosions.\n\nMSRs were first developed in the 1960s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US and showed great promise. But they never reached commercial viability, largely because housing the corrosive salts safely proved technically challenging and expensive.\n\nTo counter this, Thorizon\u2019s design uses a system of cartridges. Each massive steel cylinder is filled with molten salt and a mix of spent fuel from traditional reactors and fresh thorium \u2014 a radioactive material much more abundant than uranium and safer to handle. The idea is that these cylinders can simply be replaced once the radioactive part of the fuel has largely been depleted.\n\n\u201cThe cartridge approach lets us isolate the most extreme conditions inside the reactor,\u201d said Lauwers. \u201cIt\u2019s modular, replaceable, and gives us a safe way to deal with radioactive materials.\u201d\n\nThorizon spun out from the Netherlands\u2019 nuclear research institute NRG in 2018. It now employs around 50 engineers split between Amsterdam and Lyon. The company says it has completed its conceptual design and is engaged in regulatory talks with Dutch, French, and Belgian authorities.\n\nThree pre-feasibility studies are underway for potential launch sites in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Industry partners, including Dutch manufacturing giant VDL, are helping prototype core components.\n\nBy blending spent uranium fuel with thorium in a molten salt reactor, Thorizon aims to create a cleaner, more sustainable source of nuclear energy. It could turn a huge nuclear waste problem into a solution for Europe\u2019s clean energy future. But the benefits won\u2019t come cheap.\n\nFunding a nuclear waste renaissance\n\nSo far, Thorizon has raised \u20ac42.5mn, including funding from the French government and Dutch bodies such as Invest-NL and the Brabant Startup Fonds. However, that\u2019s just a fraction of the \u20ac750mn it says it needs to begin building its prototype reactor.\n\nThe long timelines, strict regulations, and high upfront costs of nuclear startups typically make them a hard sell. \u201cTo bring the technology to life, public-private partnerships are crucial,\u201d said Lauwers. \u201cSome of the money being spent on burying nuclear waste could be instead diverted to reusing it.\u201d\n\nGovernment backing will be crucial, she said, as will venture capital. However, the CEO said that being based in Europe may put the company at a disadvantage from a funding perspective.\n\n\u201cIn the US, relatively small teams have been able to scale much faster, obtain more private funding, and obtain their licenses,\u201d she said. \u201cHere in Europe, that can take longer.\u201d\n\nTerraPower and X-Power are two examples. Each SMR startup has raised over $1bn to commercialise its technology. In Europe, by contrast, no tech companies have attracted a fraction of that funding.\n\nHowever, if Thorizon manages to overcome the hurdles, it could hit three birds with one stone: cleaning up nuclear waste, reducing Europe\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, and supplying stable baseload power to homes and industries.",
