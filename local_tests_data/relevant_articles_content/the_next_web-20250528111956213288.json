That has been changing over the last few years.\u201d\n\nThis reluctance to make bold bets is illustrated in the funding gap across the Atlantic. Despite having more than twice the population, European tech firms struggle to attract the investments going to their American counterparts. In 2024, US startups raised $178bn, more than triple the $51bn figure for Europeancompanies, according to Crunchbase\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sign up now!\n\nLeCun\u2019s comments came in response to an X post by Arnaud Bertrand, the French founder of rental marketplace HouseTrip, who has had his own struggles building a startup in Europe.\n\nBertrand founded HouseTrip in 2009, a year before the launch of a similar startup: Airbnb. HouseTrip also planned to make booking an apartment as simple as booking a hotel, but couldn\u2019t compete with its American rival. Airbnb, which is now valued at over $80bn, grew into one of the world\u2019s greatest tech successes.\n\nHousetrip struggled to compete with the cash-flushed unicorn. Two years after Airbnb entered the European market in 2012, Bertrand stepped down as CEO. In 2016, TripAdvisor acquired the company for an undisclosed sum, before incorporating it into the travel site Holiday Lettings.\n\nBertrand took to social media today to push back against a recent Wall Street Journal article that scrutinised Europe\u2019s tech sector. Published Monday, the piece blamed the region\u2019s sluggish performance on overregulation, fragmented markets, limited access to capital, and a risk-averse business culture.\n\nBertrand agreed with some of the criticisms, but added that they \u201care all secondary.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on my experience, the key problem faced by European startups can be summarised in one word: patriotism,\u201d he said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is virtually [no patriotism] in Europe, and more than anything that\u2019s what\u2019s killing EU startups, or preventing them from developing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAccording to Bertrand, one of the reasons his startup failed to beat Airbnb was a lack of patriotism among investors and media in Europe \u2014 a determination to back their own startups.\n\nLeCun, however, has a different view on the causes. \u201cNot sure I would call this a lack of patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cMore like a lack of self-confidence.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s tech competitiveness will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
