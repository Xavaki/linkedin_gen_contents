    "content": "TNW Backstage returns this week to explore one of tech\u2019s most fascinating frontiers: brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).\n\nThe capabilities of these neural devices are rapidly expanding. They\u2019ve been implanted in skulls and worn as headbands. They\u2019ve measured focus, treated Parkinson\u2019s disease, and enabled paralysed people to control computers with their minds.\n\nA range of research labs and tech firms are developing BCIs. Yet the spotlight has been dominated by one company: Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. The startup has put brain implants in monkeys so they can play Pong with their minds. Musk also has big plans for humans, from giving us \u201csuperpowers\u201d to downloading our memories.\n\nBut shockingly, not everyone is keen on the idea of Elon controlling their brains. Thankfully, there are other options. One of them comes from Dutch healthtech company MindAffect.\n\nThe company uses BCIs primarily for hearing and visual tests. Worn as headbands, the devices analyse the brain\u2019s responses to stimulation, which reveals what the user saw or heard. It\u2019s completely non-invasive, affordable, and requires little staff support.\n\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nMindAffect\u2019s CEO, Jennifer Goodall, discusses the system on this week\u2019s episode of TNW Backstage.\n\nWe revisit her session from TNW Conference 2024 and discuss the healthtech trends shaping this year\u2019s event. You can listen to the show on Spotify, at our dedicated website, or via the media player at the bottom of this article.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, check out our previous episodes of the podcast, which goes behind the scenes of TNW Conference and the tech shaping our world.\n\nIn our debut show, we explored the data security landscape \u2014 and Meta\u2019s controversial \u201cpay or consent\u201d model \u2014 with Ron de Jesus, the world\u2019s first Field Chief Privacy Officer. In our second episode, comedy content creator Derek Mitchell and TNW co-founder Boris discussed the value of humour in tech businesses.\n\nTo celebrate the podcast\u2019s launch, we\u2019re also offering an exclusive discount on tickets for TNW Conference, which takes place in Amsterdam on June 19 and 20. You\u2019ll find the offer hidden in each episode of TNW Backstage.\n\nThanks for reading \u2014 and now, for listening too.\n\n\n\n",
