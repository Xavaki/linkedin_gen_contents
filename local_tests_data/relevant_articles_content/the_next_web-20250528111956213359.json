    "content": "Have you heard of the privacy paradox? It\u2019s the contradiction between our claims to care about privacy \u2014 and our refusal to protect it.\n\nThe paradox came to mind while working on the debut episode of our brand-new podcast: TNW Backstage.\n\nThe show takes you behind the scenes of TNW Conference \u2014 and the tech shaping our world. Our first episode features a standout guest: Ron de Jesus, the world\u2019s first Field Chief Privacy Officer.\n\nThe conversation explores the evolution of privacy threats. One hot topic is Meta\u2019s controversial \u201cpay or consent\u201d model, which gives users a stark choice: allow ad-tracking or go ad-free for a fee.\n\nWhen we spoke to Ron last year, the strategy was drawing fire from regulators, civil society groups, and nonprofits. But did that scare users away?\n\nNot really. Meta\u2019s user base has continued growing \u2014 and the company is doubling down on the model. It\u2019s a prime example of the privacy paradox in action.\n\nIn TNW Backstage, we dig into these tensions and other big privacy issues. We also discuss how they\u2019re shaping the agenda for this year\u2019s TNW Conference.\n\nTo celebrate the podcast\u2019s launch, we\u2019re offering an exclusive discount on tickets for the event, which takes place on June 19 and 20. Tune in to TNW Backstage on Spotify or via the podcast\u2019s homepage.\n\nThanks for reading \u2014 and now, for listening too.",
