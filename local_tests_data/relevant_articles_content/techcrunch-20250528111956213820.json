    "content": "Sebastian Siemiatkowski is leaning all the way into the idea that his buy-now-pay-later, IPO-bound startup Klarna is an AI company. When Klarna delivered updated quarterly earnings on Monday, it was his AI avatar (pictured above) that presented the highlights, according to the company\u2019s YouTube video.\n\nOther than AI Siemiatkowski\u2019s admission, it wasn\u2019t obvious that this was AI. There were only a few subtle signs: AI Siemiatkowski didn\u2019t blink as much as most humans do. The voice sync was good, but not perfect. The AI was also wearing a brown jacket that looked a lot like the one from a widely circulated corporate photo of his human self (though the shirt was different).\n\nKlarna, which is getting ready to debut as a public company, was using the updated financials to tout AI as a driving factor for hitting 100 million users. It credited its use of AI for a fourth consecutive profitable quarter, explaining that it \u201cstreamlined its workforce by ~40%,\u201d the company said in its blog post, driving up revenue per employee to nearly $1 million.\n\nHuman Siemiatkowski specified to CNBC that \u201cthe company has shrunk from about 5,000 to now almost 3,000 employees.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the first CEO to poke fun at the idea of an AI replacing a CEO. AI sales agent startup Artisan, known for its viral \u201cstop hiring humans\u201d ad campaign, posted an April Fool\u2019s video of its CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack being fired and replaced with an AI CEO.\n\nBut maybe the idea of AIs replacing CEOs isn\u2019t a total joke. While it\u2019s certainly true that some CEOs \u2014 especially at startups \u2014 do get their hands dirty coding features or cold-calling prospects, a CEO\u2019s main jobs are to set strategy, make decisions, and take responsibility for those decisions.\n\nWho better than an AI built on a SATA reasoning model to digest large swatches of company data, study gobs of successful business strategy, and use that to make decisions? In fact, research published in Harvard Business Review last year found that an AI could, mostly, outperform human CEOs, based on a model using GPT-4o.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This is because it did poorly responding to \u201cblack swan events, such as market collapses during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the researchers found. Still, as AI advocates like to point out, these are early days. Future AI CEOs may learn to excel at that, too.\n\nKlarna declined additional comment.",
