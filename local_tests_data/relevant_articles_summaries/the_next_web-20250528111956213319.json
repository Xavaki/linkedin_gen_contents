These AI tools handle repetitive, time-consuming work such as retrieving data, checking regulations, or analyzing policies, enabling human experts to focus on higher-value activities and client engagement. Importantly, Ravical emphasizes that its agents suggest decisions rather than act autonomously, ensuring traceable and auditable outputs critical in regulated industries.
