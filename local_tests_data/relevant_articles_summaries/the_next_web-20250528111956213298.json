Already installed in over 6,000 stores across 25 countries, the technology alerts store operators if theft-like behavior is identified, allowing them to decide on further action. With U.S. retailers reporting $40 billion in shoplifting losses in 2022, the solution provides businesses an enhanced tool to combat inventory shrinkage while protecting privacy.\n\nThis matters to business leaders because retail theft is a significant financial drain and operational challenge, particularly in regions experiencing enforcement declines.
